# Resume-ready Project Blurb

Designed and developed a centralized, editor-integrated AI cognitive workspace enabling coordinated multi-model interactions, version-controlled prompt intelligence, and persistent context orchestration. Implemented prompt versioning, cross-model context transfer, audit logging, and editor-native integrations with commercial-grade security and scalability using a Node.js backend, MongoDB, and a VS Code extension. Reduced cognitive load and eliminated manual AI mediation for developer workflows; suitable for enterprise deployment with RBAC and on-prem options.
